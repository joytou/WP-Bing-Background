== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the background not show the image? =

1. Please make sure that the domain name in the 'Interface Domain Name' column is Bing's official domain name. As stated in the description, don't modify it casually unless it doesn't work or it makes you feel unsatisfactory.
2. Please try several more times to save the settings of this plugin so that it can regenerate the required static resource files.
3. Please check whether the directory 'wp-content -> uploads -> bing' exists, whether there were any files in it, and whether that files can be opened and read normally. If it is broken, please delete it and refresh your website again.
4. Please ensure that you do not use any cache, because once you use the cache, what you get will always be the result of the cache unless you clear the cache to ensure that it can get the latest static resource files.
5. If all the above methods cannot solve your problem, please contact me through email <joytou.wu@qq.com > to help you solve the problem in a timely manner.
